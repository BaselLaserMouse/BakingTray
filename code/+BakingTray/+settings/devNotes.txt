Developer notes: settings system
Also see: recipe class

There are two sorts of "settings":
- "recipes" (scan settings files) and associated rig hardware descriptions, like the rig name and cutting paramaters.
- The settings needed to connect to "components" (classes that are used to control the hardware).

** Recipes and scan settings
Each acquisition is controlled by a "recipe" that is defined by a YAML file. 
The YAML file is read by readRecipe and defines two structures: sample and mosaic. 
These contain the settings which will be highly sample specific. 

Parameters that are specific to the rig are stored in: <BAKINGTRAYROOT>/SETTINGS/systemSettings.yml
This file is not shipped with the repository but is created by readSystemSettings based on 
the information in default_BT_Settings.m which is in the private sub-directory in <BAKINGTRAYROOT>/+BakingTray/+settings

Recipes are read by readRecipe, which ensures that a valid recipe is returned. Parameters that have
implausible or dangerous values are coerced to values from the default recipe in the private sub-directory.
