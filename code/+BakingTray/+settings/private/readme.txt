These files are used by BakingTray for inital set up and to 
set safe default values in case the copies in the SETTINGS
folder have invalid values. Do not edit these files unless 
you *really* know what you're doing.


These files are read by other functions. e.g. the componentSettings.m
file is read by BakingTray.settings.readComponentSettings
