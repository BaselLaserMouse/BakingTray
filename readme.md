### What is it?
BakingTray is an open-source serial section 2-photon imaging system inspired the [TeraVoxel](https://github.com/TeravoxelTwoPhotonTomography) project ([Economo et al](https://elifesciences.org/articles/10566)) but runs  within [MATLAB](http://www.mathworks.com/) using the [ScanImage](https://vidriotechnologies.com/) [API](https://github.com/tenss/ScanImageAPI_Examples).

### Who is it for?
This software is aimed at technically-minded people who want an open source STP solution that can be modified for their needs. 
Setting up BakingTray requires _significant effort_, good MATLAB programming skills, knowledge of ScanImage, and the know-how to set up and run a 2-photon microscope. 
_This is not a turn-key solution_.
BakingTray will run on any hardware [supported by ScanImage](http://scanimage.vidriotechnologies.com/display/SI2017/Supported+Microscope+Hardware).

### How does it work?
BakingTray is based upon an [existing tile-scanner extension for ScanImage](https://github.com/BaselLaserMouse/ScanImageTileScan).
BakingTray simply slices off the top of the sample after each tile-scan is complete, exposing fresh tissue for imaging. 
Imaging itself is performed via ScanImage, which is freely available MATLAB-based software for running 2-photon microscopes. 

### Current features
This software has been thoroughly stress-tested and is capable of generating production-quality data.
The current feature set is as follows:

* Easy sample set up: take a fast preview image of the sample then draw a box around the area to be imaged. 
* Acquisition of up to four channels using resonant or linear scanning.
* A low-resolution preview image of the current section is assembled in real time.
* Graceful acquisition abort (either immediately or at the end of the current section) and pausing.
* Automatically halts if the laser drops out of modelock. 
* PMTs and laser automatically switched off at the end of the acquisition.
* Support for multiple lasers via Scanimage.
* Easy control of illumination as a function of depth via ScanImage. 
* Integrates with our [StitchIt](https://github.com/BaselLaserMouse/StitchIt) software for assembling the stitched images from raw tiles. 
* Easily resume of a previously halted acquisition. 
* Modular API allows developers to easily extend the software or adapt it to different hardware.
* Slack messages on acquisition completion.
